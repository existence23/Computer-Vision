function [outputs] = Classify(W, b, data)
% [predictions] = Classify(W, b, data) should accept the network parameters 'W'
% and 'b' as well as an DxN matrix of data sample, where D is the number of
% data samples, and N is the dimensionality of the input data. This function
% should return a vector of size DxC of network softmax output probabilities.

D = size(data, 1);
C = length(b{end});
outputs = zeros(D, C);

for i = 1 : D
    [out, ~, ~] = Forward(W, b, data(i, :));
    outputs(i, :) = out';
